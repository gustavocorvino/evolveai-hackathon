# Document an Existing Project

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive documentation for existing projects optimized for AI development agents. This task creates structured reference materials that enable effective contribution.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Initial Project Analysis

**CRITICAL:** First, check if a PRD or requirements document exists in context. If yes, use it to focus your documentation efforts on relevant areas only.

**IF PRD EXISTS**:

- Review the PRD to understand what enhancement/feature is planned
- Identify which modules, services, or areas will be affected
- Focus documentation ONLY on these relevant areas
- Skip unrelated parts of the codebase to keep docs lean

**IF NO PRD EXISTS**:
Ask the user:

"I notice you haven't provided a PRD or requirements document. To create more focused and useful documentation, I recommend one of these options:

1. **Create a PRD first** - Would you like me to help create a brownfield PRD before documenting? This helps focus documentation on relevant areas.

2. **Provide existing requirements** - Do you have a requirements document, epic, or feature description you can share?

3. **Describe the focus** - Can you briefly describe what enhancement or feature you're planning? For example:
   - 'Adding payment processing to the user service'
   - 'Refactoring the authentication module'
   - 'Integrating with a new third-party API'

4. **Document everything** - Or should I proceed with comprehensive documentation of the entire codebase? (Note: This may create excessive documentation for large projects)

Please let me know your preference, or I can proceed with full documentation if you prefer."

Based on their response:

- If they choose option 1-3: Use that context to focus documentation
- If they choose option 4 or decline: Proceed with comprehensive analysis below

Begin by conducting analysis of the existing project. Use available tools to:

1. **Project Structure Discovery**: Examine the root directory structure, identify main folders, and understand the overall organization
2. **Technology Stack Identification**: Look for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc. to identify languages, frameworks, and dependencies
3. **Build System Analysis**: Find build scripts, CI/CD configurations, and development commands
4. **Existing Documentation Review**: Check for README files, docs folders, and any existing documentation
5. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Sample key files to understand coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches

Ask the user these elicitation questions to better understand their needs:

- What is the primary purpose of this project?
- Are there any specific areas of the codebase that are particularly complex or important for agents to understand?
- What types of tasks do you expect AI agents to perform on this project? (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring, testing)
- Are there any existing documentation standards or formats you prefer?
- What level of technical detail should the documentation target? (junior developers, senior developers, mixed team)
- Is there a specific feature or enhancement you're planning? (This helps focus documentation)

### 2. Deep Codebase Analysis

CRITICAL: Before generating documentation, conduct extensive analysis of the existing codebase:

1. **Explore Key Areas**:
   - Entry points (main files, index files, app initializers)
   - Configuration files and environment setup
   - Package dependencies and versions
   - Build and deployment configurations
   - Test suites and coverage

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**:
   - "I see you're using [technology X]. Are there any custom patterns or conventions I should document?"
   - "What are the most critical/complex parts of this system that developers struggle with?"
   - "Are there any undocumented 'tribal knowledge' areas I should capture?"
   - "What technical debt or known issues should I document?"
   - "Which parts of the codebase change most frequently?"

3. **Map the Reality**:
   - Identify ACTUAL patterns used (not theoretical best practices)
   - Find where key business logic lives
   - Locate integration points and external dependencies
   - Document workarounds and technical debt
   - Note areas that differ from standard patterns

**IF PRD PROVIDED**: Also analyze what would need to change for the enhancement

### 3. Core Documentation Generation

Generate a comprehensive BROWNFIELD architecture document that reflects the ACTUAL state of the codebase.

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT an aspirational architecture document. Document what EXISTS, including:

- Technical debt and workarounds
- Inconsistent patterns between different parts
- Legacy code that can't be changed
- Integration constraints
- Performance bottlenecks

The document should be comprehensive enough that future agents can understand:

- The actual state of the system (not idealized)
- Where to find key files and logic
- What technical debt exists
- What constraints must be respected
- If PRD provided: What needs to change for the enhancement

### 4. Document Delivery

1. **In Web UI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude)**:
   - Present the entire document in one response (or multiple if too long)
   - Tell user to copy and save as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` or `docs/project-architecture.md`
   - Mention it can be sharded later in IDE if needed

2. **In IDE Environment**:
   - Create the document as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
   - Inform user this single document contains all architectural information
   - Can be sharded later using PO agent if desired

### 5. Quality Assurance

CRITICAL: Before finalizing the document:

1. **Accuracy Check**: Verify all technical details match the actual codebase
2. **Completeness Review**: Ensure all major system components are documented
3. **Focus Validation**: If user provided scope, verify relevant areas are emphasized
4. **Clarity Assessment**: Check that explanations are clear for AI agents
5. **Navigation**: Ensure document has clear section structure for easy reference

Apply the advanced elicitation task after major sections to refine based on user feedback.

## Success Criteria

- Single comprehensive brownfield architecture document created
- Document reflects REALITY including technical debt and workarounds
- Key files and modules are referenced with actual paths
- Models/APIs reference source files rather than duplicating content
- If PRD provided: Clear impact analysis showing what needs to change
- Document enables AI agents to navigate and understand the actual codebase
- Technical constraints and "gotchas" are clearly documented

## Notes

- This task creates ONE document that captures the TRUE state of the system
- References actual files rather than duplicating content when possible
- Documents technical debt, workarounds, and constraints honestly
- For brownfield projects with PRD: Provides clear enhancement impact analysis
- The goal is PRACTICAL documentation for AI agents doing real work
